## üöÄ Usage

To replicate the results, please spin up an AWS SageMaker instance (in our case, we used ml.t3.2xlarge), clone this repository, and run main.sh. If you already have the processed data (see below), then feel free to comment out the scripts used for downloads.

### üí° Tutorial on Using the Histone Mark Age Predictors

FThe tutorial below provides a step-by-step guide to using the histone mark age predictors. A more detailed version is also available in the Jupyter notebook inside the 'tutorial' folder named 'tutorial.ipynb'.

1. **Load required packages:**
   Import the necessary packages for data processing and prediction.

2. **Download an Example File from the ENCODE Project:**
   Execute the command to download a training sample (bigWig file) used in the models.

3. **Process the bigWig File:**
   Use the function \`process_bigWig(bigWig_file_path, annotation_file_path)\` to extract genomic annotations and transform signal values.

4. **Predict the Histone Mark Age:**
   Utilize the function \`predict_histone_mark_age(processed_sample, histone)\` to predict age based on the processed sample for a given histone type.

5. **Print the Result:**
   The code will print the predicted histone mark age.

Example code snippet:
```python
sample = process_bigWig('ENCFF386QWG.bigWig')
histone_mark = 'H3K4me3'
y_hat = predict_histone_mark_age(sample, histone=histone_mark)[0]
print(f'The predicted {histone_mark} age is {round(y_hat,3)} years.')
```

## üì¶ Data availability

All data used was publicly available from the ENCODE project. This can be programmatically accessed and downloaded through the scripts in this GitHub. Nevertheless, to download the already-processed data with the results, please access our Zenodo repository [here](URLXXXXXXX).
